## Contentful: GraphQL vs. REST

Contentful provides two APIs: REST and GraphQL. You can choose the one that best fits your needs. We suggest you to check the differences between them before you start building your application.

Contentful > GraphQL > [**GraphQL tools for getting started with Contentful**](https://www.contentful.com/blog/graphql-tools-for-getting-started-with-contentful/)

> **IMPORTANT**: To get the feeling of how you can access and query your data using the GraphQL API, you can use GraphiQL app within Contentful dashboard. To do so, you have to install the app first. Go to the Contentful dashboard, click on the "Apps" tab, and search for "GraphiQL". Install the app and start querying your data.
