# Building Your Application

For fun, you can try to integrate an AI model into your application. Many providers offer free credits to get started. Vercel provides an excellent AI SDK that you can use to integrate AI models into your application.

Getting Started > [**Next.js App Router**](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/getting-started/nextjs-app-router)

> NOTE: In the present branch, I have integrated the AI model offered by X (ex. Twitter) called `grok`. For more info: [**xAI**](https://x.ai/).
>
> To access/test the model you have to add an appropriate API key (in `.env`). The UI chat interface is available at `/ai` route.
